# HyperCortex

**Semantic profiling system for LLMs across hyperparameter and quantization space.**

HyperCortex is a test harness and diagnostic tool designed to map the behavioral contours of language models across combinatoric hyperparameter configurations. Through structured test batteries, it reveals how quantization, temperature, prompt framing, and context shaping affect metrics such as hallucination rate, coherence, relevance, and perplexity. It produces signature charts like the "Task Solvability vs. Bit Depth" curve, identifying the precision thresholds at which distinct cognitive task classes become tractable. While it does not orchestrate models, HyperCortex surfaces the empirical profiles needed for downstream routing, benchmarking, and model selection.
